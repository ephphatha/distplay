# Gamepad Visualisation
This repository was originally forked from https://github.com/Tiyenti/distplay, which was released under the ISC license. I have completely rewritten the code to use CSS grid layouts and HTML5 data attributes in an effort to avoid absolute layout positioning and the slightly inconsistent layout used in that repository. The visual style/layout is similar but the code is hopefully simpler and easier to read.

I do not support remapping controls (yet), and sticks are currently broken while I work out how to position elements using css data attribute access.
